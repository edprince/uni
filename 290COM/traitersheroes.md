# Are people like Julian Assange or Edward Snowden traitors or heroes of the information age? 

Moral considerations are the most straight forward to analyse, and so
they shall form the opening of this piece, on the behaviour of high-profile information dealers
such as Julian Assange or Edward Snowden. 

Whatever the consequences, legality or social impact of their actions, there is no question that
both Edward Snowden and Julian Assange were acting for what they believed in, and on behalf of
people in general. Whether one would deem their actions to be "right" or "wrong", there was genuine
belief that the information these men published was thought to have been the right of the public to
know. Morally, therefore it would be easy to come to the simple conclusion that these men should be
seen as heros. This however is only in relation to their famous incidents. Although the verdict is 
yet to be decided, given that Assange is thought to be guilty of sexual assault, during his time in 
Sweden, it is difficult to view him entirely as a hero. 

Ethically, it is hard to have a shared vision with NSA when it comes to mass surveillance, as it
instinctively feels like an unwanted breach of privacy. The dictum 'you have nothing to fear if you
have nothing to hide' appears to justify this surveillance to the NSA. For the majority of people
this would never present an issue, but does that mean that they have the right for their personal
data to be collected without them knowing? No. In the UK there are firm laws about the use of personal
data as of the Data Protection Act 1998. Any individual whose data is being used has the right to know 
exactly what data has been collected on them, and exactly how it is intended to be used. Although the
law is not so firm in the US, it could be argued that the UK take on the situation is more ethical, and
therefore Snowdens actions were ethical. If this is the case, it raises his status closer to that of being
a hero of the information age.

Socially, the actions of both men were rewarding and damaging. Whilst people were happy without knowing
that they were subject to mass surveillance, once discovered, it created huge uncertainty and paranoria
throughout society, once they were informed their privacy had been compromised. The release of the data
from Assange could be viewed as equally damaging to society, once the data (such as the Manning documents),
had been released, although wiser, the public would have been shocked, again damaging the society. Equally,
it could be argued that in both cases, the publicity of this data made society more aware about the reality
of the modern world, which could be seen as benefitting socially.

Legally, both men have definitely crossed boundaries. Assange remains in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,
unable to leave without being arrested. Having recently been denied the courtesy of attending the funeral
of a close friend, he very much remains a potential victim of the law. Snowden technically stole millions
of classified government documents, enough to prosecute him under the Espionage Act 1917. He currently
resides in an unknown location in Moscow, again, unable to come public as he will be arrested and charged
in the US.

In conclusion, the decision to view them as heros or traiters cannot be taken in such a binary format. If
the law is incorrect in these scenarios, then why does it exist? Given that this is our most accepted way
of judging right and wrong, and both men have defied it, how can they ever be classified as heros? Equally,
when approaching the question from a moral or ethical perspective, it is almost difficult to see them as
anything other than heros of the information age.
