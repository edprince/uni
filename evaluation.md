#Evaluation and reflection of the LRG#
 - Program development
 - Academic/study skills acquired
 - Professional practices acquired for personal career development

##Program Development##
Despite creating a (mostly) working game, meeting the required specifications,
there are certainly many things as a group we could have done to save ourselves
time. Firstly, we picked a robot before we had fully decided on a game. This
consequently meant we had to find a way to make our robot achieve the tasks we
set it, or change the tasks itself. A prime example is the colour sensor. We
positioned it on the left hand side (a central point was not available). This
meant we had to change the design of the maze many times, and make it extremely
consistent, otherwise the robot would come off the pathway.

A repetition of the project would also see us spend more time in planning,
carefully planning which modules of the project each member would be most suited
to leading/completing.

##Academic/Study skills acquired##
The requirements for the formal report writing throughout this project has
without doubt enhanced report writing skills, particularly regarding
referencing and a formal writing style. This has been hugely beneficial, and
especially since the reports have been small in size. 

In addition to this, we also finish the project with experience of presenting
our work to a group. Being capable of explaining your work to others is a vital 
skill, and this experience has taught us the value of excessive preparation for 
a presentation. 

##Professional Practice##
Collaboration for a project such as this is vital, as it often is in industry.
This has given us a chance to experiment, and now reflect upon the methods we
have used to attempt to successfully collaborate on our project. The majority of
our collaboration was performed through the use of Facebook and Google Docs. In
future, websites such as GitHub or BitBucket may be very useful for
collaboration. We decided early on in the project not to use this, due to the
different levels of knowledge and experience within the group.

Once again, the experience of presenting work to a group is a very vital skill
to have in industry. Even if not to a group, it is always beneficial to be
capable of effectively explaining your work to others.

Delegation of tasks according to team members specific skill sets is a very
important task within industry, creating the most efficient work-forces,
especially important in leadership roles within an organization.
