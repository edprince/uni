It is likely the commissioner will then launch a full investigation into Schrems's
complaints. Schrems went to the high court in Ireland after the commissioner
refused to investigate his concerns on the grounds the "safe harbour" system,
which allowed tech companies to send personal data to the US, was overseen by
the European commission. The case judge subsequently referred the case to the
European court of justice which ultimately struck down "safe harbour". Dixon
said: "The issues dealt with in the judgment are complex."In declaring the old
"sSafe Harbour" rules invalid, however, the significance of the judgment extends
far beyond the case presently pending in Ireland." Murphy said there was now
an opportunity "to set robust global standards for the protection of personal
data". "The legitimate and safe use of personal data, and indeed the need for
data transfer must always be balanced with strong standards for the protection
for personal data," Murphy said.
