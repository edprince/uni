##The Bad Design##
The heater in my hall of residence rooms are confusing to operate, since the
temperature dial lies above and to the left of the unit itself. However, this
does not operate unless the power switch (located directly underneath the
heater, making it difficult to see) is also switched on. This problem could be
solved by moving the power switch up next to the dial which controls the heater.
