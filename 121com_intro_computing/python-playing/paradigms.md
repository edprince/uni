#Paradigms#
Imperative - Reassigned memory. Statements. Abstraction of processor. Oldest
method. Analogous to recipes and lists of intstructions.

Declarative - Desired results, rather than how to get them. Control flow
implicit, not specified. Opposite to imperative. Difficult to write purely
declarative. 

Procedural - Use of functions and defining functions to use elsewhere. Cuts down
on amount of re-written code.

Structural - Has built in control structures for selections/iteration.
