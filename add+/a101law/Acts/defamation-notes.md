DEFAMATION ACT 2013

EXPLANATORY NOTES

INTRODUCTION

1. These explanatory notes relate to the Defamation Act 2013, which received Royal
Assent on 25 April 2013. They have been prepared by the Ministry of Justice in order
to assist the reader in understanding the Act. They do not form part of the Act and have
not been endorsed by Parliament.

2. The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Act. They are not, and are not meant
to be, a comprehensive description of the Act. So where a section or part of a section
does not seem to require any explanation or comment, none is given.
SUMMARY

3. The Defamation Act 2013 reforms aspects of the law of defamation. The civil law on
defamation has developed through the common law over a number of years, periodically
being supplemented by statute, most recently the Defamation Act 1952 ("the 1952 Act")
and the Defamation Act 1996 ("the 1996 Act").
BACKGROUND

4. The Government's Coalition Agreement gave a commitment to review the law of
defamation, and on 9 July 2010 the Government announced its intention to publish a
draft Defamation Bill. The Draft Defamation Bill (Cm 8020) was published for full
public consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny on 15 March 2011.
5. The public consultation closed on 10 June 2011. The Ministry of Justice received
129 responses from a range of interested parties. A comprehensive summary of the
responses received was published on 24 November 2011 ( Draft Defamation Bill
Summary of Responses to Consultation CP(R) 3/11) . In addition to the Government
consultation, pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill was undertaken by a Parliamentary
Joint Committee. The committee held oral evidence sessions between April and July
2011 and its final report was published on 19 October 2011 ( The Joint Committee on
the Draft Defamation Bill Report Session 2010-2012, HL 203, HC 930-I).
6. The Government response to the Joint Committee's report was published on 29
February 2012 ( The Government's Response to the Report of the Joint Committee on the
Draft Defamation Bill Cm 8295) and set out the Government's conclusions including
on certain matters raised in the public consultation but not specifically addressed in the
Committee's report.
TERRITORIAL EXTENT AND APPLICATION

the Welsh Ministers.
9. The Act amends a number of enactments which extend to Scotland and Northern
Ireland as well as to England and Wales. These amendments, apart from that made by
section 7(9) which extends to Scotland, will extend to England and Wales only.
COMMENTARY ON SECTIONS
Section 1:Serious harm
10. Subsection ( 1) of this section provides that a statement is not defamatory unless its
publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the
claimant. The provision extends to situations where publication is likely to cause serious
harm in order to cover situations where the harm has not yet occurred at the time the
action for defamation is commenced. Subsection ( 2) indicates that for the purposes of
the section, harm to the reputation of a body that trades for profit is not "serious harm"
unless it has caused or is likely to cause the body serious financial loss.
11. The section builds on the consideration given by the courts in a series of cases to
the question of what is sufficient to establish that a statement is defamatory. A recent
example is Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd 1
 in which a decision of the House
of Lords in Sim v Stretch 2
 was identified as authority for the existence of a "threshold
of seriousness" in what is defamatory. There is also currently potential for trivial cases
to be struck out on the basis that they are an abuse of process because so little is at
stake. In Jameel v Dow Jones & Co 3
 it was established that there needs to be a real
and substantial tort. The section raises the bar for bringing a claim so that only cases
involving serious harm to the claimant's reputation can be brought.
12. Subsection ( 2) reflects the fact that bodies trading for profit are already prevented from
claiming damages for certain types of harm such as injury to feelings, and are in practice
likely to have to show actual or likely financial loss. The requirement that this be serious
is consistent with the new serious harm test in subsection ( 1).
Section 2:Truth
13. This section replaces the common law defence of justification with a new statutory
defence of truth. The section is intended broadly to reflect the current law while
simplifying and clarifying certain elements.
14. Subsection ( 1) provides for the new defence to apply where the defendant can show
that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true. This
subsection reflects the current law as established in the case of Chase v News Group
Newspapers Ltd 4
, where the Court of Appeal indicated that in order for the defence of
justification to be available "the defendant does not have to prove that every word he
or she published was true. He or she has to establish the "essential" or "substantial"
truth of the sting of the libel".

15. There is a long-standing common law rule that it is no defence to an action for
defamation for the defendant to prove that he or she was only repeating what someone
else had said (known as the "repetition rule"). Subsection (1) focuses on the imputation
conveyed by the statement in order to incorporate this rule.
16. In any case where the defence of truth is raised, there will be two issues: i) what
imputation (or imputations) are actually conveyed by the statement; and ii) whether
the imputation (or imputations) conveyed are substantially true. The defence will apply
where the imputation is one of fact.
17. Subsections ( 2) and (3) replace section 5 of the 1952 Act (the only significant element
of the defence of justification which is currently in statute). Their effect is that where the
statement complained of contains two or more distinct imputations, the defence does
not fail if, having regard to the imputations which are shown to be substantially true,
those which are not shown to be substantially true do not seriously harm the claimant's
reputation. These provisions are intended to have the same effect as those in section 5
of the 1952 Act, but are expressed in more modern terminology. The phrase "materially
injure" used in the 1952 Act is replaced by "seriously harm" to ensure consistency with
the test in section 1 of the Act.
18. Subsection ( 4) abolishes the common law defence of justification and repeals section 5
of the 1952 Act. This means that where a defendant wishes to rely on the new statutory
defence the court would be required to apply the words used in the statute, not the
current case law. In cases where uncertainty arises the current case law would constitute
a helpful but not binding guide to interpreting how the new statutory defence should
be applied.
Section 3:Honest opinion
19. This section replaces the common law defence of fair comment 5
 with a new defence
of honest opinion. The section broadly reflects the current law while simplifying and
clarifying certain elements, but does not include the current requirement for the opinion
to be on a matter of public interest.
20. Subsections ( 1) to (4) provide for the defence to apply where the defendant can show
that three conditions are met. These are condition 1: that the statement complained of
was a statement of opinion; condition 2: that the statement complained of indicated,
whether in general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion; and condition 3: that an
honest person could have held the opinion on the basis of any fact which existed at the
time the statement complained of was published or anything asserted to be a fact in a
privileged statement published before the statement complained of.
21. Condition 1 (in subsection ( 2)) is intended to reflect the current law and embraces the
requirement established in Cheng v Tse Wai Chun Paul 6
 that the statement must be
recognisable as comment as distinct from an imputation of fact. It is implicit in condition
1 that the assessment is on the basis of how the ordinary person would understand it.
As an inference of fact is a form of opinion, this would be encompassed by the defence.
22. Condition 2 (in subsection ( 3)), reflects the test approved by the Supreme Court in
Joseph v Spiller 7
 that "the comment must explicitly or implicitly indicate, at least
in general terms, the facts on which it is based". Condition 2 and Condition 3 (in
subsection ( 4)) aim to simplify the law by providing a clear and straightforward test.
This is intended to retain the broad principles of the current common law defence as
to the necessary basis for the opinion expressed but avoid the complexities which have
arisen in case law, in particular over the extent to which the opinion must be based
on facts which are sufficiently true and as to the extent to which the statement must
explicitly or implicitly indicate the facts on which the opinion is based. These are areas

where the common law has become increasingly complicated and technical, and where
case law has sometimes struggled to articulate with clarity how the law should apply
in particular circumstances. For example, the facts that may need to be demonstrated
in relation to an article expressing an opinion on a political issue, comments made on
a social network, a view about a contractual dispute, or a review of a restaurant or play
will differ substantially.
23. Condition 3 is an objective test and consists of two elements. It is enough for one to be
satisfied. The first is whether an honest person could have held the opinion on the basis
of any fact which existed at the time the statement was published (in subsection ( 4)a)).
The subsection refers to "any fact" so that any relevant fact or facts will be enough. The
existing case law on the sufficiency of the factual basis is covered by the requirement
that "an honest person" must have been able to hold the opinion. If the fact was not a
sufficient basis for the opinion, an honest person would not have been able to hold it.
24. The second element of condition 3 (in subsection ( 4)b)) is whether an honest person
could have formed the opinion on the basis of anything asserted to be a fact in a
"privileged statement" which was published before the statement complained of. For
this purpose, a statement is a "privileged statement" if the person responsible for its
publication would have one of the defences listed in subsection ( 7) of the section if an
action was brought in respect of that statement. The defences listed are the defence of
absolute privilege under section 14 of the 1996 Act; the defence of qualified privilege
under section 15 of that Act; and the defences in sections 4 and 6 of the Act relating to
publication on a matter of public interest and peer-reviewed statements in a scientific
or academic journal.
25. Subsection ( 5) provides for the defence to be defeated if the claimant shows that the
defendant did not hold the opinion. This is a subjective test. This reflects the current
law whereby the defence of fair comment will fail if the claimant can show that the
statement was actuated by malice.
26. Subsection ( 6) makes provision for situations where the defendant is not the author
of the statement (for example where an action is brought against a newspaper editor
in respect of a comment piece rather than against the person who wrote it). In these
circumstances the defence is defeated if the claimant can show that the defendant knew
or ought to have known that the author did not hold the opinion.
27. Subsection ( 8) abolishes the common law defence of fair comment. Although this means
that the defendant can no longer rely on the common law defence, in cases where
uncertainty arises in the interpretation of section 3, case law would constitute a helpful
but not binding guide to interpreting how the new statutory defence should be applied.
28. Subsection ( 8) also repeals section 6 of the 1952 Act. Section 6 provides that in an
action for libel or slander in respect of words consisting partly of allegations of fact
and partly of expression of opinion, a defence of fair comment shall not fail by reason
only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved if the expression of opinion
is fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged or referred to in the words
complained of as are proved. This provision is no longer necessary in light of the new
approach set out in subsection ( 4). A defendant will be able to show that conditions 1,
2 and 3 are met without needing to prove the truth of every single allegation of fact
relevant to the statement complained of.
Section 4:Publication on matter of public interest
29. This section creates a new defence to an action for defamation of publication on a
matter of public interest. It is based on the existing common law defence established
in Reynolds v Times Newspapers 8
 and is intended to reflect the principles established
in that case and in subsequent case law. Subsection ( 1) provides for the defence to be
8 [2001] 2 AC 127.
These notes refer to the Defamation Act 2013 (c.26)
which received Royal Assent on 25April 2013
5
available in circumstances where the defendant can show that the statement complained
of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest and that he
reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was in the public
interest. The intention in this provision is to reflect the existing common law as most
recently set out in Flood v Times Newspapers 9
. It reflects the fact that the common law
test contained both a subjective element - what the defendant believed was in the public
interest at the time of publication - and an objective element - whether the belief was
a reasonable one for the defendant to hold in all the circumstances.
30. In relation to the first limb of this test, the section does not attempt to define what is
meant by "the public interest". However, this is a concept which is well-established
in the English common law. It is made clear that the defence applies if the statement
complained of "was, or formed part of , a statement on a matter of public interest" to
ensure that either the words complained of may be on a matter of public interest, or
that a holistic view may be taken of the statement in the wider context of the document,
article etc in which it is contained in order to decide if overall this is on a matter of
public interest.
31. Subsection ( 2) requires the court, subject to subsections (3) and (4), to have regard to
all the circumstances of the case in determining whether the defendant has shown the
matters set out in subsection (1).
32. Subsection ( 3) is intended to encapsulate the core of the common law doctrine
of "reportage" (which has been described by the courts as "a convenient word to
describe the neutral reporting of attributed allegations rather than their adoption by
the newspaper" 10). In instances where this doctrine applies, the defendant does not
need to have verified the information reported before publication because the way
that the report is presented gives a balanced picture. In determining whether for the
purposes of the section it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that publishing
the statement was in the public interest, the court should disregard any failure on the
part of a defendant to take steps to verify the truth of the imputation conveyed by the
publication (which would include any faction ( 3) applies.
33. Subsection ( 4) requires the court, in  given to editors in judgments such as that of
Flood, but is noubsection ( 5) makes clear for the avoidance of doubt that the or opinion.
35. Subsection ( 6) abolishes the common law defenc constitute a
helpful (albeit not binding) guide to interpreting case law into consideration
where appropriate.
Section 5:Operators of websites
36. This section creates a new defence for the operators of websites where a defamation
action is brought ag respect of a statement posted on the website.
9 [2012] UKSC 11n who posted the statement; that they gave the operator a notic currently provides for absolute privilege to
apply to fair and accurate reports of proceedings in public before any court in the UK;
the European Court of Justice or any court attached to that court; the European Court
of Human Rights; and any international criminal tribunal established by the Security
Council of the United Nations or by an international agreement to which the UK is a
party. Subsection ( 1) replaces this with a new subsection, which extends the scope of
the defence so that it also ions relating to art, science, religion or learning, trade assoended, amendments
are made by subsections ( 4), (7)(b) and (10)tends the defence to summaries of notices or other matter issue qualified privilege under Part 1 of Schedule 1 extends to fair and EU member states. Subsections ( 4), (6)(a), (7),

It achieves this by extending t extends a provision in the 1996 Act (which provides for

academic conference, t 2 qualified privilege

1980 Act (section 4A concerns the time limit applicable for defamation actions) is
interpreted as a reference to the operation of section 4A together with section 8. Section
32A provides a broad discretion which requires the court to have regard to all the
circumstances of the case, and it is envisaged that this will provide a safeguard against
injustice in relation to the application of any limitation issue arising under this section.
