#Primary Characteristics#
Based on common law
---
Any legal system which historically, principles have been decided through the judiciary. Laws were exported to
Birtish colonies.
Adversarial nature
---
Your responsibility to produce evidence. In criminal cases, it is the responsibility of the police to investigate
cases and produce evidence. Then liase with the crown prosecution service, who determines whether to proceed to court.
Simply, one party against another, there is a winner, and there is a loser. **Alternative dispute depositions** mean
that both parties may come to an agreement and both "win".

Unwritten constitution
---
Details the operation of state organizations. There is not one, single document that contains the entire British
constitution. Case law, highlights issues in realation to our consititution. Conventions - traditional practices.
When breached, the individual will not be prosecuted, but will not get off free. 

##Seperation of powers##
Put forth by Montesque. French legal philosepher (legal theory - why we have laws). Supposed to prevent against
dictatorships. *Executive* runs the country on a day to day basis. New laws, administers new law. Any organization
funded by tax payer. *Legislatives* is the Houses of Parliament, monarchs. They create the law. *The judiciary* 
uphold and enforce the law. Lord Chancellor (barrister, sat in cabinet). Was a member of the house of lords, and 
whas head of the judiciary. This role used to offend the principle of separation. Judiciary develop principles of
equity. They have a role in law creation. Parliament can delegate law making power to other people. Local council 
can create laws through powers of delegation. Semi-public and private companies can create by-laws. National Trust
can too. More contraversially, the Queen, Monarch and privy council can have law making power. Members of the
Executive can be delegated law making power. Manifesto's are not legally binding documents. 

##Supremacy of parliament##
Theory put forth by Dicey (check handout for spelling). Parliament is all powerful, can create any law on any topic.
Prior to 1st Jan 1973 (Joined the European Union). EU laws can override some in Britain.

These are legal doctrines, something that the country should try to achieve.
