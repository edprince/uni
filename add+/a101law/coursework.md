[Contributes 100 % to total module mark]  

###COURSEWORK GUIDANCE###
In relation to this coursework task, compiling a formal report, you will be
required to undertake two preparatory activities for the contents of the
report:-

1.Directed research activity at the Magistrates Court (Observational
exercise/note taking exercise).  
2.Undertake research on the role played by laypersons as members of juries
and the general operation of the jury system within the English Legal System
(textbook/research exercise)
Read all the following information detailed below so you are clear what you
have to do.  

##ACTIVITY 1 - GUIDANCE##
Reading about the law and how it operates is one thing but there is nothing
better than immersing yourself within the real life operation of the English
legal system to gain a real appreciation of the system of justice in operation.
This first directed study activity requires you to do just that. For some of you
this may be your first glimpse of the real operation of the legal system. This 
is a directed research activity which you can undertake in teams of 2 or on an
individual basis - please ensure that you read all the directions listed below.
? Ensure that you have adequate writing materials and paper for all individuals
to write notes on observations - RECORDING DEVICES OF ANY KIND ARE
NOT ALLOWED WITHIN COURT BUILDINGS AND IF FOUND WILL BE
CONFISCATED AND STUDENTS WILL BE PROSECUTED FOR ATTEMPTED
CONTEMPT OF COURT YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!   
The Coventry Magistrates Court have been informed that students from
Coventry University will be attending court sessions and making notes from
the public gallery (you do not however have to attend Coventry Magistrates
Court any Magistrates Court can be visited by your team providing it is
operational).

You are all ambassadors for not only the University but also more
importantly yourselves - individuals within the court could potentially be
future employers so ensure that you are on your best behaviour. Do not take
bags and ensure that mobiles and any other telecommunication devices are
witched completely off - you will be searched by court staff so I would
suggest that metal objects on your person should be reduced to a minimum -
note there is no safe storage place for bags and you will not be allowed to
take bags into the court.

Attend the court and go to the reception area usually situated close to the
inside of the main entrance of the court building and ask to speak to a court
usher - explain to the court usher that you are students from Coventry
University and wish to view court proceedings and take notes on those
proceedings - S/he will know what is happening in any particular courtroom
on that specific day - the usher may direct you to a specific court or give
you a choice of courts to visit. The usher will direct you to where you need to sit within the court room -
court etiquette requires that you do not talk whilst proceedings are taking
place - compare notes after you leave the court room not during court
proceedings- when the Magistrate/s enter and leave the room all individuals
within the court must rise and sit as and when directed by the court usher
(individual wearing the black gown). I would recommend that you sit within
the courts for around 2 hours - if you want to stay longer by all means do
so - for instance perhaps because the case is of particular interest and you
want to see the final outcome. 

The court is a formal place and although you do not need to 'dress up' you
should make sure that you are dressed appropriately and it is WISE TO
DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOUR MOBILE IS SWITCHED OFF (not merely on
silent nor on meeting setting etc) before you enter the court room, in order
not to disturb the work of the court, it is best to find a seat where
directed by the court usher as quickly and quietly as possible. You will find
seating within the public gallery usually at the back of the court - sit only
where directed to by the court usher.

As mentioned already those present in court must stand when the
Magistrates or District Judge enter or leave the court room and whilst in
court the public are expected not to disturb proceedings in any way.
Ensure that you follow the directions of the court usher at all times (wears
a black gown within the court building).
Undertake all the following tasks whilst at the court:-

###Task 1###
Draw a diagram of the court identifying the following clearly:-

 * Magistrates Bench - location within the court room where the Magistrate/s
sit.
  * Clerk of the Court - sits in front of the Magistrate/s
  * Witness box
  * Location of defendant.
  * Location of defendant's solicitor.
  * Location of Crown Prosecutor 
  * Location of the public gallery - the place where you were required to sit
  within the court room to view proceedings.
  * Location of entrance into the court room.
  * Court number which your diagram represents

#Task 2#

Record the following information in your notes:  

  * Address location of court (including city/town if not attending the Coventry
  Magistrates Court) - Coventry Magistrates Court is situated at, 60 Little
  Park Street, Coventry, CV1 2SQ
  * Date of visit.
  * Start time of visit.
  * Total time spent within the court building.
  * Total time spent within the court rooms (in total).
  * Court number/s visited.

#Task 3#
Record the following details in your notes for each of the cases that
you hear within the court room/s:  

  * Name of defendant
  * Charges against the defendant
  * Basic facts of the case - circumstances of the offence in question.
  * Witnesses provided for defendant- basic details of evidence given.
  * Witnesses provided for the prosecution - basic details of evidence given.
  * Highlight the outcome of case - what happened at the end of the trial - was
  the defendant sentenced? If so what was the sentence given? Length of
  sentence, level of fine etc? Was a further trial hearing set for the case?
  * Highlight how many magistrates heard the case.
  * Highlight the form of Magistrate dealing with the case
  * Highlight the characteristics of the Magistrate/s that heard the cases in
  terms of approximate age, ethnicity, sex.
  * Length of time taken to deal with each case.

Once you have completed your court visit write up the information you have
recorded as the first part of your report - ensure that you include the court
diagram as well.

##ACTIVITY 2 - GUIDANCE##
Research the role played by laypersons as members of juries (both civil and
criminal) within the English legal system and the general operation of the jury
system (this can include additionally criticisms, reforms etc). You may want to
start your research initially by re-reading your lecture handouts which contain
basic information on the role played by Juries.

Part 2 of your report will detail the information you have obtained in relation
to the above research activity - imagine you are writing this document for
fellow students whom are not on the A101 Law module and have no knowledge
of this area. Ensure that you support your answer with relevant legal authority
cases/statutes to support your points where applicable.

PLAGIARISM WARNING ! - Assignments should not be copied in part or in
whole from any other source, except for any marked up quotations, that
clearly distinguish what has been quoted from your own work. All references
sed must be given, and the specific page number used should also be given for
any direct quotations, which should be in inverted commas. Students found
copying from the internet or other sources will get zero marks and may be
excluded from the university. 

FURTHER INFORMATION ON TURNITIN, PLAGIARISM AND
COURSEWORK- A NOTE FOR STUDENTS
Turnitin is a service that helps both lecturers and students to check if a piece
of coursework contains sections that are identical to work submitted or
published elsewhere. However, you should note that:  
* Not all sources found by Turnitin are necessarily plagiarised  
* Work may be plagiarised even if Turnitin does not find any overlaps  

Nevertheless, it is still a very useful tool to help detect if plagiarism may be
present.
PLAGIARISM - A REMINDER OF THE UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS
The rules on Plagiarism are very simple. Everything you put in an assignment
must be written in your own words. If you copy what others have written this
is plagiarism, unless you clearly mark up the quoted section in inverted commas
so that there is no mistake as to where your own work stops and the quoted
work begins and ends. Just listing references used at the end is insufficient to
mark up a quotation. You are normally expected to use information from other
sources, which should be referenced correctly, but you should not just copy
what others have written. Marks are awarded for your own analysis and
application of this material.
TURNITIN REPORTS
When you view your Turnitin report via the link on your module web you will see
a small coloured box with your Turnitin "score", which indicates the percentage
of your work that matches other sources. If you click on this box you should
be able to view the full report for the whole of your coursework.
Turnitin highlights any sections overlapping with other sources, colour codes
them and puts them in boxes with a reference number that corresponds to the
list of sources that Turnitin has found. It will therefore pick up the titles of
sources used in reference lists and commonly used phrases, and properly
marked up quotations. The university would not pursue a case of plagiarism
against a student where these were the only overlaps highlighted. However, if
other sources are found to have been directly copied this may lead to a case
of plagiarism being brought.

Turnitin scores are useful to give a quick indication of where plagiarism may be
present, but it is not possible to give a precise cut off score for when a case
of plagiarism will be pursued or not. One student may have a 20% score
because they have copied a large chunk from one particular source, which is
plagiarism, while another student may have a 20% score because they have got
a long reference list or they have frequently repeated a longish phrase that is
relevant to the topic but which Turnitin keeps picking up, eg "Baumol's sales
revenue maximising theory of the firm", which would not be considered
plagiarism.
Overlaps with work submitted at other universities - sometimes students may
see a section of their work highlighted as "Submitted to University of XXX".
Although this may signify that you have actually copied work that a student at
this other university has submitted, this is unusual (although it does sometimes
happen). What this usually means is that you have both copied from the same
source (such as a book, a bought essay, or perhaps an on-line source that is
now no longer on the web) and so Turnitin has picked up the other student's
work rather than the original source. You should be aware that essay banks
sometimes sell the same essay to different students (even if they say it is
especially written for the purchaser) and the essays they produce are
sometimes plagiarised.
Overlaps with work submitted at Coventry University - sometimes students may
see a section of their work highlighted as "Submitted to Coventry University".
This normally means that these sections are identical to another student's work
or to work you have submitted yourself for another module. (Overlaps with
your own drafts that have been submitted on the same module web should not
be picked up by Turnitin.)
