###European court of justice struck down provisions allowing transfer of EU citizens' data to the US after Austrian student argued NSA might get access to it###

In a landmark ruling on Tuesday the European court of justice struck down the "safe harbour" arrangements with the US amid concerns it gives American intelligence agencies access to European citizens' data.
"The judgement has clarified that it is now for the data protection commissioner to revisit Mr Schrems's complaint and carry out the necessary investigations," said Dara Murphy, the Irish data protection minister.
Meanwhile, the Irish data protection commissioner Helen Dixon has instructed her legal team "to take whatever actions are necessary to bring the case back as soon as practicable before the Irish high court".

It is likely the commissioner will then launch a full investigation into Schrems's complaints.
Schrems went to the high court in Ireland after the commissioner refused to investigate his concerns on the grounds the "safe harbour" system, which allowed tech companies to send personal data to the US, was overseen by the European commission.
The case judge subsequently referred the case to the European court of justice which ultimately struck down "safe harbour".
Dixon said: "The issues dealt with in the judgment are complex.
"In declaring the old "sSafe Harbour" rules invalid, however, the significance of the judgment extends far beyond the case presently pending in Ireland."
Murphy said there was now an opportunity "to set robust global standards for the protection of personal data".
"The legitimate and safe use of personal data, and indeed the need for data transfer must always be balanced with strong standards for the protection for personal data," Murphy said.

###Family judge announces guidance to deal with Isis-linked court cases as it emerged that almost half of people referred to deradicalisation scheme were under-18###

Family courts may need to have "early access" to information extracted from "seized electronic equipment" if it is relevant to the hearing, he added. 
"The family courts should extend all proper assistance to those involved in the criminal justice system, for example, by disclosing materials from the family court proceedings into the criminal process."
Munby's guidance was published as it emerged that more than 300 of the 796 people referred to the government's Channel deradicalisation scheme between June and August this year were aged under 18.
