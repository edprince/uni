###Family judge announces guidance to deal with Isis-linked court cases as it emerged that almost half of people referred to deradicalisation scheme were under-18###

Family courts may need to have "early access" to information extracted from "seized electronic equipment" if it is relevant to the hearing, he added. 
"The family courts should extend all proper assistance to those involved in the criminal justice system, for example, by disclosing materials from the family court proceedings into the criminal process."
Munby's guidance was published as it emerged that more than 300 of the 796 people referred to the government's Channel deradicalisation scheme between June and August this year were aged under 18.
