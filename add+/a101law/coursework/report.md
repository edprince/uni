#Formal Report on City Link's prosecution under Trade Union and Labour Relations(Consolidation) Act 1992#
##Introduction to the case##
Three ex-directors of the former firm 'City Link' have been prosecuted under the 
Trade Union and Labour Relations(Cosolidation) Act of 1992 after failing to give 
the Secretary of state notice 90 days before announcing nearly 3000 job losses 
following the collapse of the firm in 2013. 

This was the second day of the trial, and therefore the first director had
already been questioned.

##The court layout and members present##
<insert court diagram>
Present in the court was the Judge, the clerk, the defendants, two lawyers,
(people behind the lawyers) and the attendants in the public gallery.  

##Details on the case##
There were three defendants being prosecuted: David Smith, Robert Peto and
Thomas Wright, all ex-directors of City Link, the managing director, the
financial director and a non-executive director respectively.
The case began with the room standing in respect to the Judge as he entered.
Shortly after this, the first of the three defendants was called to the stand to
answer questions. Once there, he took an oath to only speak the truth. The first
defendant was the ex-City Link financial director, a middle aged man called
Robert Peto. He was asked to keep his eyes on the judge when listening and
responding to questions. Throughout his questioning, the lawyers made it very
clear to include the phrase: "to your understanding", meaning that the
defendants could only answer to the best of their knowledge, and wouldn't be
lying if something they believed to be true was in fact incorrect or factually
inaccurate. 

The key point during the case was whether the company knew that the jobs would
have been lost when the company went into administration. If so, then the
directors would have been breaking the law by not notifying the Secretary of
State about the imminent redundancies. Robert Peto claimed that his sole focus
was on how to get the company into administration, but not think about the
consequences of doing that, since that is what their advisors had suggested as
being the best course of action for the company. This is due to the fact that
selling a business through administration can mean dropping some of its
liabilities. 

##Ending the session##
It appeared that the prosecuting lawyer has the right to go first should he
wish. 
liabilities. 

##Outcome of the case##
The three directors were found not guilty of the charges against them, the judge
deciding that they had demonstrated their intent to try and revive the company,
and therefore their innocence on failing to notify the Secretary of State about
the forthcoming redundancies that were to follow the collapse of the company.
