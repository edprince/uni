# Own Project - Discovering Global Climbing Communities

This project has been designed to visualize groups of climbers/mountaineers from
an unseen perspective. The data is not readily available, and therefore has been
scraped online from as many sources as possible, but this however does not
guarantee its validity. Hopefully this will give an idea of what could be acheived
with large quantities of the correct data.

Mountains and climbers are both inserted into the graph as nodes. Climbers have 
their names, descriptions, and a tag of whether they are alive or dead. This information
is stored in a Google Docs spreadsheet. The mountain nodes contain their names, their
heights, their range, and the number of deaths they have recorded. Lastly, the connections
are stored in the same manner as nodes, but as ascents, with a tag of whether it was a first
ascent or not. Once clustered, this begins to display the groups of climbers who have climbed
similar ranges, or mostly in the same countries, or mountains of similar heights etc.
