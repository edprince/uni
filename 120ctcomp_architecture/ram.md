#RAM#
RAM can be divided into two technologies, DRAM and SRAM. DRAM is Dynamic Ram.
This type of RAM is made with cells that store data as charges on capacitors.
The presence or absence of a charge is interpreted as binary. It requires
periodic charge refreshing to maintain the correct data. The term dynamic is
applied due to the charge tending to leak away, even with constant power being
supplied.

SRAM is Static RAM. They use the same logic components as a processor. Binary
values are stored using the traditional flip-flop logic gate configurations, it
holds its data as long as power is supplied. It is a more expensive type of RAM,
and is faster.
