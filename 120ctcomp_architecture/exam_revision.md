Machine Instructions
====================

-   Instructions that processor executes
-   Micro operations

Characteristics
===============

Machine instructions are executed by the processor. The collection of
instructions is referred to as the collection set.

Elements
========

-   Opcode
-   Specifies the operation to be performed, specified by a binary code.
-   Operand
-   Result operand reference
-   Next instruction reference

Instruction Representation
==========================

16 bit instruction, 4 bits = opcode, next 12 (6, 6) used for 2 operands.

Assembly language looks as such: `ADD.B D2, D3`\
An assembler takes this assembly language code and transforms it into
machine code that can be executed on the processor.

Assembly language is hardware dependent. A different assembly language
for each processor.

Instructions in assembly can make reference to specific registers in the
processor.

Definition: \> A symbolic representation of the machine language of a
specific processor, \> augmented by additional type of statements

Compiler translates high-level language into machine code. Executable
code is generated by the assembler, that the processor can execute.

Generations of computers
========================

-   1st: Vaccum tube
-   2nd: Transistors
-   3rd: Integrated circuit

1st Generation
==============

ENIAC
-----

von Neumann consulation with ENIAC. He was born in Hungary. Was a
mathematician.

EDVAC
-----

Most notably attributed to von Neumann

UNIVAC
------

2nd Generation
==============

Introduction of transistors into the building of processors. Not until
lste 1950s that fully transitorized computers were commercially
available.

3rd Generation
==============

Single, self contained transistor. Also on tehh circuit board are
resistors and capacitors.

Interrupts
==========

Interrupts are a mechanism by which a normal sequence of events can be
prevented. There are multiple types of interrupts, that are caused by
different situations. - Program Interrupts - This could caused by an
overflow error, or a division by zero - Timer - Generated by internal
processor timer - Used in a pre-emptive multi-tasking - I/O - From an
I/O controller - Hardware failure - I.e a memory parity error

The interrupt cycle is added to the instruction cycle, and the processor
checks for interrupt, indicated when there is an interrupt signal. If
there is an interrupt pending, the processor suspends the execution of
the current program, and saves the context. Then set PC to start address
of the interrupt handler routine. Then it processes the interrupt before
restoring the context and continuing the interrupted program.

Multiple Interrupts
-------------------

Disable interrupts are processed in the sequence as they occur. Whilst
one interrupt is being handled, the rest are left pending. The processor
will ignore further interrupts until the current interrupt has been
handled.

Define priorities, this allows interrupts to be assigned a priority,
meaning a low-priority interrupt can be interrupted by a high-priority
interrupt.

Oculus Rift
-----------

### Introduction

The Oculus Rift is part of the next wave of gaming. The device is placed
over a users eyes, cover their face partially, and allows a world to be
brought to life. The player feels like part of a world that spans
360degrees around them, they can look around, move their head around and
the worlds react accordingly.

### Historical Development

### Current Status

The Oculus have currently released two iterations of the rift,
Development Kit One, and Development Kit Two (shortened to DK1, and
DK2). \#\#\#Analysis of employed technologies\#\#\# The current
iteration of the Oculus Rift also uses an infra-red sensor, which is
placed accordingly to capture the rifts movements accurately.

RAM
===

RAM can be divided into two technologies, DRAM and SRAM. DRAM is Dynamic
Ram. This type of RAM is made with cells that store data as charges on
capacitors. The presence or absence of a charge is interpreted as
binary. It requires periodic charge refreshing to maintain the correct
data. The term dynamic is applied due to the charge tending to leak
away, even with constant power being supplied.

SRAM is Static RAM. They use the same logic components as a processor.
Binary values are stored using the traditional flip-flop logic gate
configurations, it holds its data as long as power is supplied. It is a
more expensive type of RAM, and is faster.

Function Units from Logic Gates
===============================

Decoders
========

Manager call 7 assistants. 2 options:\
 a: Seven individual lines

b: Three lines used to indicate the number of the assistant. Suitable
**decoding** logic is then required at the end of the 3 lines to pick
out the correct assistant.

  A   B   C   Result
  --- --- --- -------------------
  0   0   0   No call
  0   0   1   First assistant
  0   1   0   Second assistant
  1   0   0   Third assistant
  0   1   1   Fourth assistant
  1   1   0   Fifth assistant
  1   0   1   Sixth assistant
  1   1   1   Seventh assistant

A functional unit commonly used either on its own or integrated into a
much larger circuit would have all of the decoders in the same block.
For the above example, this would be a 3-to-8 line decoder. For larger
numbers of selections 4-to-16 or 5-to-32 decoders could be used.

Encoders

Multiplexers
============

llows a number of signals to share a single line. Allows only one output
at any given time.
