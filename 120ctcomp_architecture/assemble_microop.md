#Machine Instructions#

 - Instructions that processor executes
 - Micro operations

Characteristics
===============
Machine instructions are executed by the processor. The collection of
instructions is referred to as the collection set.

Elements
========
 - Opcode
  - Specifies the operation to be performed, specified by a binary code.
 - Operand
 - Result operand reference
 - Next instruction reference

Instruction Representation
===========================
16 bit instruction, 4 bits = opcode, next 12 (6, 6) used for 2 operands. 

Assembly language looks as such: ``ADD.B D2, D3``  
An assembler takes this assembly language code and transforms it into machine
code that can be executed on the processor.

Assembly language is hardware dependent. A different assembly language for each
processor.

Instructions in assembly can make reference to specific registers in the
processor.

Definition:
 > A symbolic representation of the machine language of a specific processor,
 > augmented by additional type of statements

Compiler translates high-level language into machine code. Executable code is
generated by the assembler, that the processor can execute.

separately compiled program modules into a single file.
